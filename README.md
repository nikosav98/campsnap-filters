# campsnap-filters

This program was made to easily switch filters on the Campsnap camera.
Tested on my own Camp Snap.

IMPORTANT: After installing a new filter, as per the site states, restart the camera twice,
waiting about 10-20 seconds for the light to stop flashing.

This program may be flagged as a false-positive, meaning a very few antivirus softwares
may pick it up as a virus.
This happens due to the compiler being used, and probably my lack of technical knowledge :)
